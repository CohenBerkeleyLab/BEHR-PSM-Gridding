This needs to be compiled and installed before using.
Make sure that you have a Cython-compatible C compiler
(like gcc) installed. Intel compilers may be tricky, but
you can try them. Then run the following two commands:

python setup.py build
python setup.py install --user

You should then be able to import the "omi" module as long
as you are not in this directory, or probably any directory
with a subdirectory named "omi."

If you make changes to the cgrate.pyx file, you need to change
USE_CYTHON in setup.py from False to True. This will require
you to have Cython and a C compiler installed on your computer.

For users compiling on the UC Berkeley Savio cluster: I find that
I must compile this with the following modules loaded:

1) python/2.7.8       2) numpy/1.9.0        3) scipy/0.14.0       4)setuptools/6.0.2
5) gcc/4.4.7          6) lapack/3.4.2-gcc   7) git/2.2.2

(+h5py if not on the no-he5 branch, +cython if compiling from the pyx rather
than c file). If I have intel compilers/modules loaded, the compilation fails.
