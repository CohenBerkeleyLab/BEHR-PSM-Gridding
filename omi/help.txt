This needs to be compiled and installed before using.
Make sure that you have a Cython-compatible C compiler
(like gcc) installed. Intel compilers may be tricky, but
you can try them. Then run the following two commands:

python setup.py build
python setup.py install --user

You should then be able to import the "omi" module as long
as you are not in this directory, or probably any directory
with a subdirectory named "omi."
